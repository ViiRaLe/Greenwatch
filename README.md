Greenwatch is a simple but challenging 3D arcade game made in collaboration & commissioned from Acer Italia in Unity3D.
The objective is simple: grow your forest and stop the city from spreading!

It sensitize the forest fires targeting kids in elementary school while making them have fun!

The game can be played in couch-coop (max 2 players),the players can select one of two available characters (Boy & Girl) to play.

The game features a small but powerful AI to make the city spread, to create buildings and to burn down your trees and sprouts. At the end of the game timer the more trees are planted the higher the score, giving you a badge with a brief explanation and some interesting infos about forests and trees.
